# School_District_Analysis
## Overview of the school district analysis:
We will be helping the chief data scientist for a City School District, Maria with analyzing data on students funding and students standardized test scores. We are given access to every studentâ€™s math and reading test scores as well as various information on the schools that they attend. Our task is to aggregate the data and showcase trends and school performance. This analysis will assist the School Board and Superintendent in making decisions regarding the school budgets and priorities. We are given two datasets in CSV format: school_complete.csv [https://github.com/Cryptotwister/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/schools_complete.csv] and [a relative link](students_complete.csv).
